<p>Hello there! Welcome to my desk. Please, come in and make yourself at home. Take a seat, have some coffee, and take your time sifting through my desk. I&rsquo;ve got something for everyone. A sample of my <a href="https://ivylee.weblog.lol/game-works/narrative-design-doc">workflow</a> can be found on the top, <a href="https://ivylee.weblog.lol/game-works/items-and-vegetations">items</a> are in the right drawer and <a href="https://ivylee.weblog.lol/game-works/locations">locations</a> in the left. <a href="https://ivylee.weblog.lol/game-works/characters">Characters</a> can be found stuffed into the middle drawer, and various other works are hidden here and there. And if you&rsquo;re looking for me, look no further than the figure spying on you from underneath the floorboards. Yes, those are my eyes blinking between the panels. Don&rsquo;t mind me.</p>
<p>My name is Ivy, also known as that creature spying on you from below the floors. I&rsquo;d shake your hand, but I don&rsquo;t think it would fit between the boards Allow me to instead share a little bit about myself before you begin rifling through my desk. I have been making worlds to play around in since I was nothing more than a little floor gremlin, skulking about my childhood home. My one true love has always been creating fully immersive and emotionally impactful stories, a place people can go to disappear for a time. My creative process ensures that every piece of writing is rooted in the emotions I am trying to invoke in the reader, from the first messy concepts to the final product.</p>
