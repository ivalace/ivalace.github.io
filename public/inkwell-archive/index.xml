      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;game-of-thrones-a-retrospective&#34;&gt;Game of Thrones: A Retrospective&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has been six years since Game of Thrones ended.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, let me start by saying Game of Thrones had to have one of the worst endings ever written. Characters made decisions that made no sense for them to make, said things they would never have said in earlier situations, and overall everything just went to absolute shit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or did it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, yeah, alright. It was bad. But not for the reasons I once thought. After five years of grieving for muh queen, I have reevaluated my stance on the show and the ending. Now, I come to the people of the realm in the defense of the greatest fantasy show ever made.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
