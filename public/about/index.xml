      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;get-to-know-me&#34;&gt;Get To Know Me&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hello there!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;This is where you&amp;rsquo;d respond in your head &amp;lsquo;General Kenobi&amp;rsquo;. Yes? No? Ah, alright. I won&amp;rsquo;t hold that against you. As you&amp;rsquo;ve probably already figured out, my name is Ivy. I live in the Seattle area with my family and have been working as a writer for about five years now. I have written and self published two books under a pen name, worked on homebrew D&amp;amp;D campaigns with my friends, and just generally been tinkering in about fifty other projects. Seriously, you should see my desk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
