      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is a list of characters I have made for campaigns I have either run myself or have played as. Most come with a background, a description of appearance and some interesting notes or items they have carried/used.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;azaela&#34;&gt;Azaela&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Azaela is a Tiefling who was born blind on the streets of a coastal town. She was abandoned on the steps of an orphanage, but because of her infernal blood she was discarded and left for dead. Despite this, she was taken in by another Tiefling who ran a small thieving operation with others of their kind. She learned to rely on her other senses and became quite the charlatan, alternating between pickpocketing and conning wealthy nobles out of their accessories by hustling them with her blindness. Eventually, she managed to pilfer a ring that housed a genie. In exchange for sight, she promised to fulfill the genie&amp;rsquo;s every wish. As an adult now, she runs a shop that specializes in extravagant and beautiful adventuring gear. Obsessed with all things colorful and shiny, she enjoys making practical adventuring armor and accessories that don&amp;rsquo;t sacrifice fashion for usability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is an example of my general work flow for a game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;high-level-narrative-summary&#34;&gt;High Level Narrative Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Zokar is a Myconid with a hunger for power. Above all else, he desires to consume as much power from the world as possible and utilize it to become a new God. Using his strange abilities to grow mushrooms along the surface of the world, he spreads his spores to unsuspecting victims, drawing them to his cause and aiding him in his plans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is a collection of items and plants I have made for various campaigns I have run and novels I have written.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;items&#34;&gt;Items&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;poisoned-gauntlets&#34;&gt;Poisoned Gauntlets&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gauntlets with clawed fingertips that contain a vial of poison in each metal tip. With enough pressure, the poison released through a tiny hole into the victim&amp;rsquo;s skin. Vials contain an intense concentration and only release a few drops into the victim with each attack. Vials do need to be refilled when emptied.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Locations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is a list of notable locations I have made for Game Masters to drop into their world. These include a name and layout description, and a few other bits such as economic use, interesting landmarks and notable shops. Any that I&amp;rsquo;ve made for a campaign also include hooks to interest players into sticking around and exploring.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;wedgerock-cove&#34;&gt;Wedgerock Cove&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wedgerock Cove is a bustling trading hub, home to the Fairwind Merchants&amp;rsquo; guild hall—a collective of tradesmen and ship captains dealing in luxury goods like silks, spices, and fine jewels. While most of the coves inhabitants are upstanding citizens, a few crooked merchants have found their way into the guilds officers positions. They now use their influence to smuggle drugs and information hidden among their wares. This has caused an undercurrent of tension among the people of the cove, who can feel the unsavory nature of such deals encroaching on their affluent lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is a list of races and creature types that I&amp;rsquo;ve made for Game Masters to add to their world. Most come with special feats or abilities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;araquin&#34;&gt;Araquin&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A race of spider creatures, they possess milky white skin covered in fine hairs that can be colored in grey, black, or tan. Some grow hard, black chitin across their torso. They possess two main eyes and two smaller eyes, lidless and mostly black although there have been some known to have jewel toned colors. The females have small mandibles that grow from the side of their mouths and sharp teeth, while the males can possess two to four extra limbs that end in claws instead of hands or feet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
