## More Detailed Story Outline

Players have all come across a plague of mushrooms growing around sources of magic in their homelands. They inhaled some of the spores and now are connected to each other, with them feeling a driving need to gather in [[Locations#Motlier|Motlier]]. Once gathered in [[Locations#Motlier|Motlier]] they learn of a new kind of fungus growing along some old ruins near the town, along with a rash of stolen items and two missing villagers, [[Characters#Lhoris|Lhoris]] a newcomer to the village and Julie, an orphan woman who was raised by the village. Upon investigating, they find one of the missing villagers held captive by a Tiefling named Xeton who uses the weird mushrooms to teleport in and out of the ruins. Xeton teleports away with the missing villager, leaving behind only the clue that he was looking for someone else. 

Upon arriving back at [[Locations#Motlier|Motlier]], the group receives word that they have been summoned to [[Locations#Caidour|Caidour]] to assist the high council with a secret matter. On their way to [[Locations#Caidour|Caidour]], they cross near the town of [[Locations#Fairhaven|Fairhaven]], whose lush farmlands are suffering from a slimy black mold bubbling up through the soil. Given the lands blessing, the villagers are at a loss for how to combat it and are requesting the aid of the players as well as the first mage of [[Locations#Caidour|Caidour]]. They also learn of Fort Walker from one of the residents and can choose to investigate. In doing so, they are introduced to the Violet Ravens, an organization that spans the entire realm and can be useful for selling stolen goods and purchasing information for the rest of the story. Otherwise, they may continue on towards [[Locations#Caidour|Caidour]]. 

One last destination they could find if they explore off the beaten path is Stormsong Peak's Glistening Shallows. If they do, they will find bundles of cloth and healing herb pouches scattered about, without a monk in sight. If they investigate the stone tower, they will find the first instance of Zokar's Maw on the highest level of the tower. It's currently feeding off of the innate magical properties of the shallows, but is somewhat unstable and will react violently and unpredictably to any magic within it. The spores in the players head will whisper to them to step into the Maw, compelling them closer. They must resist. If they do not, the Maw will begin draining their magic and their life force until they manage to remove themselves from the Maw or are drained completely.

Eventually, the players will make their way to [[Locations#Caidour|Caidour]], and discover that the First Mage is also infected by the spores and was using them to bring others like him to his aide. He believes that someone has taken up residence beyond the White Crown and into the forbidden caverns. One way or another, the players must cross the White Crown, delve into the forbidden Caverns and find both Xeton and Ernir using one of the many caverns as a lair. Ernir upon seeing the party will turn angrily on Xeton, tell him to clean up his mess, and vanish in a puff of spores. The players must fight and defeat Xeton, and in doing so will learn of [[Characters#Julie|Julie]]'s whereabouts and what Xeton wanted with [[Characters#Lhoris|Lhoris]] in the first place. After his defeat, he will also disappear, leaving the players to search the lair for further information and clues.

## Characters

### Zokar

A giant Myconid looking to become a god of gluttony by consuming the magic of the world. He does not believe himself to be evil, simply a being with a need to eat and therefore it is his right to eat. His underlings are more traditionally evil, as they serve him mostly for personal gain.
- Infesting the world with mushrooms that feed off of natural sources of magic and transfer it to him
- The spores the mushrooms release infect people with a high affinity for magic and/or power
- Rainbow and luminescent in coloring and appears to be more like a mass of mushrooms, with a bubbling type of crown and a shot stem.

### Ernir

A Drow wizard, the first to discover and aid Zokar in his ascension to Godhood. She is responsible for creating the spell known as Zokar's Bite, allowing Zokar to feed from unwilling victims and track them across the multiverse.
- Is currently residing deep within the Stormsong Peaks in order to locate [[Characters#Lhoris|Lhoris]] and discover how he removed the Bite.
- Is responsible for dispatching Xeton to [[Locations#Motlier|Motlier]] to retrieve [[Characters#Lhoris|Lhoris]]
- She keeps her hair mostly short, shaved on one side of her face, straight and chin length on the other. Her hair is a extremely light shade of grey, contrasting heavily with her dark, blue-grey skin.

### Xeton

A Tiefling sorcerer who serves under Ernir, and keeps track of all those who have Zokar's Bite. Is currently in hot water with her after he lost [[Characters#Lhoris|Lhoris]]. He's extremely charismatic, cheerful, and irritating in his overly pleasant bearing.
- Typically convinces 'lower' beings such as goblins and kobolds to do his bidding, making promises he has no intention of keeping.
- He has blueish purple skin and tall grey horns that sprout directly up from his forehead. His hair is extremely long, down to his waist and kept tied back in a simple low tail.
### Julie Starchild

*Taken from [[Characters#Julie Starchild|Characters Page]]*

 Sweet, lovely Julie is the only permanent resident of the town who has no ties to it. An orphan, discovered as a baby abandoned in the middle of town square, she was raised by the entire town and is seen to all as a daughter. She grew up primarily staying with Robert and Wilmetta at [[Locations#^37acc0|Blade and Twine]] learning to cook. She loves gardening and is scared of outsiders, despite her insatiable curiosity of the outside world. Upon reaching adulthood, she took a job at [[Locations#^90781b|Boars Head Tavern]] as the cook when Boris's wife died. She is a natural born healer, something that comes out in her cooking. Her food holds a soothing element to it which is the product of her innate magic. When [[Characters#Lhoris|Lhoris]] makes an appearance in town, the two of them connect and she ends up falling deeply in love with him.

Unbeknownst to her, she Is the daughter of The Mother, making her a demigod and a born druid. When The Mother was cast down into her slumber, she sent her only true daughter to a place where she could live in peace, hidden away from the gods.

Julie has lightly tanned skin and honey blonde hair, with eyes green like the deep forest. She has a slight frame, although she is rather tall for a human woman. 

### Lhoris

 Lhoris is a former wood elf cleric of The Mother turned Sorcerer, currently residing in [[Locations#Motlier|Motlier]] searching for the [[Locations#Temple of Alva|Temple of Alva]]. He was exiled from his home and his family after unwittingly being a pawn of Xeton's to cast down The Mother. Cursed with maddening power that gets worse with every season, he was made immortal by Zokar and forced to wander the continent seeking out magical artifacts and beings. Once had the Maw of Zokar (a brand given to those who serve the Insatiable being) on his left shoulder, which allowed Xeton to track him. His father spent the last of his strength cleansing his flesh and thus removing the mark before tasking him to find Alva and convince her to restore balance to the land. His search led him to [[Locations#Motlier|Motlier]], where he was investigating the ruins near the village. There, he fell in love with Julie Starchild and now hunts her and therefore Xeton to get her back.

Lhoris is a wood elf with deep, reddish tan skin and yellow eyes. His hair is a deep shade of brown that has a golden hue in the sun, and is kept long and braided back from his face. He's tall, but very thin from the sickness inflicted on him from the bite as well as the after effects of having it removed.
