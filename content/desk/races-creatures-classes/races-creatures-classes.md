*Here is a list of races and creature types that I've made for Game Masters to add to their world. Most come with special feats or abilities.*

---
### Araquin

A race of spider creatures, they possess milky white skin covered in fine hairs that can be colored in grey, black, or tan. Some grow hard, black chitin across their torso. They possess two main eyes and two smaller eyes, lidless and mostly black although there have been some known to have jewel toned colors. The females have small mandibles that grow from the side of their mouths and sharp teeth, while the males can possess two to four extra limbs that end in claws instead of hands or feet.

Creatures of the deep and therefore nocturnal by nature, Araquin are specially designed for stealth and dexterity. The tiny hairs covering their body muffle their movements and give them a heightened sense of the world around them. They are carnivores exclusively, and tend to live solitary lives. However, there are few that have gathered in matriarchal colonies across the world. Solitary Araquin rarely seek out the colonies.

### Wound Worms

Leech-like creatures drawn to open wounds. They feed on infection and necrotizing flesh, cleaning wounds at first but burrowing deeper once all traces of sickness and decay are gone. Once they've cleaned a wound, they keep burrowing until they find other illnesses, cleaning out the body of any imperfection. Healing potions, salves, and medicine will hurt them, but after a certain point only powerful healing spells can fully drive them out and repair the damage done.

### Dream Walker

Rare beings who have the ability to enter a trance around people who are asleep and dreaming in order to walk among their dreams. They use this ability to gain knowledge of the intimate details of one's life through their dreams, and older Dream Walkers can even divine pieces of the dreamers future if given enough time.

While they are in this trance, they represent the process through a visual medium. Most prefer weaving, but there are others who will paint or even sing as they dream. This is part of the process and cannot be circumvented. If the Dream Walker is interrupted, the trance ends and the dreamer wakes immediately.

Dream Walkers cannot sleep, nor dream, and therefore tend to be a restless type of folk. Despite this, they do not like to gather, preferring to spread out and remain in civilized areas where dreams are more readily available. There are a few elders who have made their abilities known and for sale, helping people find their way or uncovering secrets hidden in their subconscious.

Most have dark hair, ranging from deep auburn to raven black. They all share the same grey and lidless eyes, which is the most distinguishing feature of the Dream Walkers. Otherwise very human in appearance, with rounded ears and fair skin. Medium build with males being slightly taller than females on average.

## Novel

*The following are races I have created for use in my novels.*

### Shadows

A form of assassin that learn to sink into darkness. They can traverse between shadows, sinking into one and emerging from another within sight. When in shadow, they are unable to use any senses and are completely numb to all things. It's easy to lose oneself in shadow, so most people do not pursue this magic. Of those who do, only a handful can learn to channel the magic in the first place and even fewer manage to emerge from their first shadow with their mind still intact. As such, there are only about twenty shadows currently known in the world.

All Shadows come from the original Shade, and unbeknownst to the rest of the world, the original Shade walks among the darkness in the shadows, stopping any who he deems unworthy from learning this magic.

### Shades

A race of being created by the Oraci to carry out their rulings on the people of the world. When there is a person who is going to make a decision to disrupt the balance, the Oraci will dispatch a shade to eliminate the threat before the choice can be acted upon. All but the first Shade is brought out from the center of the tree when they are needed, and then they vanish when they have completed their task.

### Oraci

A hive mind race of all female beings that govern at the top of the world and tend to the Tree of Duality. They are the first of the sentient beings to populate the world and are the caretakers of all living things. They derive their powers from the tree, whose roots cross the entirety of the globe and allow them to watch over all of the creatures of the world and foresee the fate of each creature on it. However, they are unable to leave the canopy of the tree, and therefore the First created a second race known as Shades.

The Oraci, being a hive mind race, all look identical with the exception of the First. They are spectral like beings wrapped in glittering robes that change from white and gold to black and silver with the turn of day to night. They lack facial features, with the exception of the white glowing orbs of light for eyes. They have no voice, no mouth and therefore do not speak, communicating within the mind.

The First, known to fey as Mother Oraci and to humans as Tamyra, possess more distinctive features, such as long, thick raven hair streaked with golden light. It moves about her as if floating in water, as do her robes which are split down the middle with an inverted silhouette of the [[Locations#Tree of Duality|Tree of Duality]].

### Void Kissed

Void Kissed are a race of beings who have been brought to face Death and been allowed to turn back. Born with pale skin and white hair, they mature at fourteen. At this age, all Void Kissed participate in a ritual where they are given a poison that stops their hearts, forcing them into the void to meet Death. Those who survive receives Death's kiss and come back with the ability to traverse the past of both person and object. For a special few, death imparts the ability to see how a person will meet their end, but at a cost. Each time these few attempt to see another's end, they must drink the poison again and go back into the void to meet with death and request the knowledge with the risk that Death will take their life as the price.

### Stormborn

Children born in the midst of a natural disaster are sometimes cursed as Stormborn, beings with Mother Nature's fury twined deep in their soul. These unlucky children possess chaotic elemental powers tied to their emotions, resulting in localized earthquakes or floods capable of destroying a small village. As they grow older, so do the powers until eventually they become a walking disaster, capable of unleashing Mother Nature's fury in powerful waves across large swaths of land. For this reason, the children are taken shortly after birth by a sect of Druids who serve the temperamental side of Nature. These Druids, all of which are Stormborn as well, raise the children to control their emotions and calm the ragged storms of the landã€‚
