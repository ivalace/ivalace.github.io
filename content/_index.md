I promise only my stories bite. I'm Ivy, narrative gremlin extraordinaire. I'd shake hands, but mine are perpetually covered in ink. I've been making worlds to play in since I was nothing more than a little floor gremlin.

Why you should summon me:
- Two self-published novels, over 150 copies sold
- Two RPG supplements on DMs Guild, over 500 downloads
- Branching narratives scripted in Ink
- An ear for character voice rivaled only by an eye for detail
- Worlds built to fit any genre or ruleset

What you get with your summons: 
- Prose seasoned precisely to your liking
- Adaptability to any medium, from zines to CRPGs
- Every word forged with precision
