Hello there! Welcome to my lair. Please, come in and make yourself at home. I promise only my stories bite. Allow me to give you a quick tour: I've got all my trophies displayed here on my mantel. The DMs Guild publications are a personal favorite. In the vault is my Lore Hoard, where I keep my precious treasures. If you need me, I'll be in the kitchen cooking up grass-fed, certified organic gremlin-made content for the Inkwell Archives.

I'm Ivy, narrative gremlin extraordinaire. I'd shake your hand, but they're perpetually covered in ink. So let me instead share a little bit about myself before you begin exploring my lair. I've been making worlds to play in since I was nothing more than a little floor gremlin, skulking about my childhood home. My one true love is creating fully immersive and emotionally impactful stories, a place people can disappear into for a time. Every piece I craft is rooted in the emotions I want to spark in the reader, from the first messy concepts to the final, polished product.
