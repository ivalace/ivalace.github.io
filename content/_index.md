Hello there! Welcome to my lair. Please, come in and make yourself at home. Allow me to give you a quick tour. I've got my all my trophy's displayed here on my mantle- the DMs Guild publications are a personal favorite. I've also got my Lore Hoard, which is where I keep my precious treasures. If you need me, I'll be in kitchen cooking up content for the Inkwell Archives.

My name is Ivy. I'd shake your hand, but they're perpetually covered in ink. Allow me to instead share a little bit about myself before you begin exploring my lair. I have been making worlds to play around in since I was nothing more than a little floor gremlin, skulking about my childhood home. My one true love has always been creating fully immersive and emotionally impactful stories, a place people can go to disappear for a time. My creative process ensures that every piece of writing is rooted in the emotions I am trying to invoke in the reader, from the first messy concepts to the final, polished product.
