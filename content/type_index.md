# Welcome to my desk!

Hello there! Welcome to my desk. Please, come in and make yourself at home. Take a seat, have some coffee, and take your time sifting through my desk. I've got something for everyone. A sample of my [workflow](https://ivylee.weblog.lol/game-works/narrative-design-doc) can be found on the top, [items](https://ivylee.weblog.lol/game-works/items-and-vegetations) are in the right drawer and [locations](https://ivylee.weblog.lol/game-works/locations) in the left. [Characters](https://ivylee.weblog.lol/game-works/characters) can be found stuffed into the middle drawer, and various other works are hidden here and there. And if you're looking for me, look no further than the figure spying on you from underneath the floorboards. Yes, those are my eyes blinking between the panels. Don't mind me.

My name is Ivy, also known as that creature spying on you from below the floors. I'd shake your hand, but I don't think it would fit between the boards Allow me to instead share a little bit about myself before you begin rifling through my desk. I have been making worlds to play around in since I was nothing more than a little floor gremlin, skulking about my childhood home. My one true love has always been creating fully immersive and emotionally impactful stories, a place people can go to disappear for a time. My creative process ensures that every piece of writing is rooted in the emotions I am trying to invoke in the reader, from the first messy concepts to the final product.
