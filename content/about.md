Hello there!

This is where you'd respond in your head "General Kenobi". As you've probably already figured out, my name is Ivy. I am a narrative gremlin living in the Seattle area with my family. I've been weaving stories and forging worlds for about five years now. I have written novels, created supplements for tired Game Masters, covered concerts for magazines, and just generally been tinkering in about fifty other projects. Seriously, you should see my hoard.

When I'm not off swimming in the chaos of creation, I enjoy consuming the works of other creators. This includes reading comics and books, learning about TTRPGs, screaming at my TV while playing video games, and watching old sci-fi shows. I feel a little obligated to say my favorites, so I'll just list them right here real quick (but fair warning: favorites are fickle things so if you ever stop me in the street, I'm likely to say something completely different).

- Favorite TV Show: Stargate SG-1. I cannot be swayed. Yes, I have seen Game of Thrones and The Good Place. I repeat, I cannot be swayed.

- Favorite Video Game: Currently? Stardew Valley. In ten minutes? Baldur's Gate 3. Yesterday? Crawl. A week ago? Ghost of Tsushima. See where I'm going with this?

- Favorite Movie: Probably a three way tie between Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and A Knight's Tale. Mostly because the writing for Chaucer is my comfort food.

- Favorite Book: The Stormlight Archive series by Brandon Sanderson. I also loved reading through the World of Warcraft Chronicles.

After publishing my first book in 2017, I splashed around in the freelance pool as a concert and event journalist. When my family relocated to Seattle, I decided to embrace my love of creative chaos. After a brief detour into homeschooling during The Great Zoompocalypse, I am back to full-time gremlin operationsâ€”tinkering, weaving, and bringing obsessive gremlin energy to your project! Let me help give your work the loving, messy writing it deserves.

I hope you enjoyed your glimpse into the madness! If you're interested in hiring me, you can contact me at [ivy@lee.social](mailto:ivy@lee.social). If you haven't yet checked out my work, you can find links to everything in my [hoard](/hoard).
