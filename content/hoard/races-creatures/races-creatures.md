# Races

## Araquin

A race of spider creatures, they possess milky white skin covered in fine hairs that can be colored in grey, black, or tan. Some grow hard, black chitin across their torso. They possess two main eyes and two smaller eyes, lidless and mostly black although there have been some known to have jewel toned colors. The females have small mandibles that grow from the side of their mouths and sharp teeth, while the males can possess two to four extra limbs that end in claws instead of hands or feet.

Creatures of the deep and therefore nocturnal by nature, Araquin are specially designed for stealth and dexterity. The tiny hairs covering their body muffle their movements and give them a heightened sense of the world around them. They are carnivores exclusively, and tend to live solitary lives. However, there are few that have gathered in matriarchal colonies across the world. Solitary Araquin rarely seek out the colonies.

## Dream Walker

Rare beings who have the ability to enter a trance around people who are asleep and dreaming in order to walk among their dreams. They use this ability to gain knowledge of the intimate details of one's life through their dreams, and older Dream Walkers can even divine pieces of the dreamers future if given enough time.

While they are in this trance, they represent the process through a visual medium. Most prefer weaving, but there are others who will paint or even sing as they dream. This is part of the process and cannot be circumvented. If the Dream Walker is interrupted, the trance ends and the dreamer wakes immediately.

Dream Walkers cannot sleep, nor dream, and therefore tend to be a restless type of folk. Despite this, they do not like to gather, preferring to spread out and remain in civilized areas where dreams are more readily available. There are a few elders who have made their abilities known and for sale, helping people find their way or uncovering secrets hidden in their subconscious.

Most have dark hair, ranging from deep auburn to raven black. They all share the same grey and lidless eyes, which is the most distinguishing feature of the Dream Walkers. Otherwise very human in appearance, with rounded ears and fair skin. Medium build with males being slightly taller than females on average.

## Void Kissed

Void Kissed are a race of beings who have been brought to face Death and been allowed to turn back. Born with pale skin and white hair, they mature at fourteen. At this age, all Void Kissed participate in a ritual where they are given a poison that stops their hearts, forcing them into the void to meet Death. Those who survive receives Death's kiss and come back with the ability to traverse the past of both person and object. For a special few, death imparts the ability to see how a person will meet their end, but at a cost. Each time these few attempt to see another's end, they must drink the poison again and go back into the void to meet with death and request the knowledge with the risk that Death will take their life as the price.

# Creatures

## Wound Worms

Leech-like creatures drawn to open wounds. They feed on infection and necrotizing flesh, cleaning surface wounds at first. Extreme caution is recommended when dealing with such creatures, for once hey've cleaned a wound, they begin burrowing through the body seeking out further illness. They feast and gorge on any imperfections until, too big to remain, the burst from the body. Healing potions, salves, and basic restorative magic can stop them from going too deep, but after a certain point only the most potent of healing can fully remove the parasite and repair the damage done.

## Behelder

Veilibri is a one of a kind anomaly of the cosmos: the product of a daydreaming Beholder. She doesn't understand where she came from, but is deeply curious and desires daily cuddles. As with the daydream that birthed her, she's incomplete and half formed. Palm sized and made of a fleshy pink goo, she has a central amethyst colored eyed and only five of the normal ten eyestalks. While those have tiny, lidless purple eyes, the other five are no more than stunted pink tentacles that wrap around the fingers of whoever is holding her. She travels the realm searching for people to hold her and teach her more about the world, keeping out of sight in her own half formed dimension.
