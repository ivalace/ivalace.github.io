*What do we do with unrefined bits? We put them in the pot and cook it till it's tasty.*

## The Nutritious Bits
*An important part of the diet for all growing adventurers.*

### The Feather of Forgetting
A quill that writes messages that disappear after they are read once. Example uses could be for discovering a spy (i.e. someone reads your message and shouldn't have, suddenly the parchments blank). Idea came from GoT Season 7 when Varys read a sealed scroll from the North addressed to Jon. Jon would never know it was read because Varys is good at resealing scrolls I guess.

### Chefs Best Friend
A necklace that is drawn towards poisonous plants. Use seems obvious, but could be useful in victims of poisoning. Like, there might be traces of the plant in the teeth of the victim or on the bowl it was served in.

### Illumineedle
A needle that makes any thread you use glow faintly. Useful in the Underdark for providing faint illumination OR inciting fear in beings of lesser intelligence. Imagine a creature with fangs and glowing eyes sewn into the cloak at your back.

### Voracious Scabbard
A scabbard or sheath that cleans and sharpens any blade put into it. Maybe it's sentient and feeds on the blood and metal shavings? Could end up damaging your blade if you don't feed it enough, like over correcting the blades edge to eat the metal.

### Deathawk Talon
A talon of an hawk that allows the holder to make a single death screech. Concussively loud, and deeply frightening.

### Skull Barrels

Barrels with a skull on top, these barrels contain the remains of a person trapped inside with a necrotizing substance. Break the barrels and a skeleton covered in purple goo will emerge and begin attacking everything around it until the purple goo dissipates and it dies.

### Meaty Read

A tome that grants the reader one of three spells at random:
- Meat Shield
	- Allows you to raise a corpse as a shield, following you around and taking hits until its body is blown to bits. Each hit knocks off a piece of it
- Corporeal Limb
	- Allows you to take a limb from a corpse and attach it to yourself, dealing passive bludgeoning damage as it punches or kicks whatever enemy dares approach you
- Bloody Mess
	- Allows you to explode a corpse, causing a mess of blood and bits to rain down on enemies, making the ground slippery and dealing damage

A wife and mother of three little ones. Lately at night, they've found themselves sleep cleaning and tidying until their hands are chaffed and knees scuffed. Is it a curse, or simply their overworked mind?

## Shower Scraps
*Because we don't waste food in this lair.*

Need a reason to curse honey coming from the bee farm in Fairhaven. All I know is the bees keep secrets.

Earth apparently used to have mushroom trees?? Definitely need an uninhabitable mushroom forest.

Would it be gruesome to have mushroom houses when Myconids exist?
