*The Gremlin Guarantee: learn my NPCs in 50 characters or less.*

### Xeton
- Ah, so you're the rats who crept into my woods.
- I suppose even rats are useful as bait.
- Be good little rodents and scurry. I'm busy.
- What beautiful, hateful eyes. Can I have them?
- Your tongue is sharp. My blade is sharper.
### Zokar
- I will be sated. Not as a myconid but as your god.
- You would do the same if you hungered as I.
- All will serve as food before my spores.
- You know not the consuming power of gluttony.
- The cravings are ceaseless. I must feast.
### Julie Starchild
- You look dreadful! Shall I cook you something?
- Please, traveler, come and rest by the hearth.
- What business brings you to our humble town?
- May I have the honor to nourish you?
- Nothing beats spiced stew on a cold, winter's day.
### Boris
- My friend, you look like you need a stiff drink!
- Ha! Who needs soap when you can buy ale!
- Welcome, friend! Come for my special brew?
- This is a place for ale, not axes.
- Disrespect my bar at your own peril, friend.
### Lhoris
- Time. I need more time. But how to get it?
- Of course I want to save her! I must save her...
- We're taught balance, but who weighs the scale?
- The allure of ascension is a dangerous beast.
- I cannot fight. But I must stop the ascension.
### Azaela
- Pink! No, lilac with spikes! Wait, who are you?
- Love the blood splatter. Very mercenary chic.
- Where did I get the claws? That's a funny story...
- Who says looks can't kill? Mine have for years!
- My armor slays as good as a blade, guaranteed!

## Scenario Writing

*Cinematic scenarios in under 200 words. Because nobody likes a ten minute monologue.*

### Percy's Purification Ritual
Percy, a legendary arch druid in my campaign, purifies his land from the corrupting influence of Zokar's spores.

Percy begins to chant, low and deep, tracing his fingers through the air. They trail a green light, leaving druidic runes glowing before him. The electric current of his magic fills the air, raising the small hairs on the back of your neck. Music, soft and sweet, rises from the earth, growing louder as the runes shift and dance in the air. Throwing open his eyes, he bursts alight, awash in nature's hues before slamming his hands into the earth at his feet.

“By the blessings of the Mother, the spirit of this land commands you! You, who would hinder her balance with your foul rot! Wither and waste before the light of her sun!”

In a blinding flash, the light explodes from him, blanketing the hills in a wave of green and gold. An awful screeching echoes from the very depths of the earth, deep, deeper than any light can be found. The spores' dying wail reverberates through your bones, the pain of it bringing you to your knees. And then as quickly as it began, silence. The fading song of the land drifting away on the wind.

### Zokar's Introduction
The moment when the party first meets Zokar, the insatiable myconid responsible for consuming all arcane energies and spreading his cult across the continent.

The cold, damp tunnels of the Underdark grow ripe with the multitude of fungi creeping along the walls. With each step, spores cloud the air, clogging your throat and obscuring your vision. Through the opalescent haze, you see the end of the tunnel, and beyond-a cavernous chamber. At the center sits the tyrant king of the myconids himself: Zokar, gluttonous one, gorger of the arcane. His stumpy legs are hidden beneath the bloated mass of his body, crowned by the multilayered swell of his fungal flesh. The iridescent folds of his skin ripple like a thousand gills, each moving in its own hypnotic pattern and polluting the air with Manamire spores. The air is thick with their sickly sweet scent, the very ground rotting beneath your boots.

Though he has no mouth, he speaks, his voice vibrating through the spores in the air and echoing in your mind. "The Relics of Ascension. At last, the pain of starvation will be sated. No more will I settle for scraps left behind by lesser beings. With these relics, I will feast not as king, but as god."

### Relics of Ascension

The astral projection of Lhoris hovers before you, his mouth drawn in a firm line. "I do not know what will come of the other gods infected by his spores. We may very well be ending divinity itself. But without intervention, Zokar will unmake the world." With a wave of his hand, he summons ghostly images of the four relics, the fifth appearing in his hand. "We must obtain the relics of ascension. If Zokar ascends, his gluttony will consume all. He must be stopped, even if we must sacrifice the gods. I have hidden them among the Nether Isles, off the coast of the Nightdust Desert. I will await your arrival at the Arcane Spire, with the final relic. Blessing upon you, traveler, while the gods still live to grant it."
