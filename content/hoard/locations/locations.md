*A list of notable locations I have made for Game Masters to drop into their world. These include a name and layout description, and a few other bits such as economic use, interesting landmarks and notable shops. Any that I've made for a campaign also include hooks to interest players into sticking around and exploring.*

---
### Wedgerock Cove

Wedgerock Cove is a bustling trading hub, home to the Fairwind Merchants' guild hallâ€”a collective of tradesmen and ship captains dealing in luxury goods like silks, spices, and fine jewels. While most of the coves inhabitants are upstanding citizens, a few crooked merchants have found their way into the guilds officers positions. They now use their influence to smuggle drugs and information hidden among their wares. This has caused an undercurrent of tension among the people of the cove, who can feel the unsavory nature of such deals encroaching on their affluent lifestyle.

The layout of the cove is one of the continent's most intriguing feats of natural architecture. It forms an inverted wedge along the eastern coastline, as if some monstrous force had ripped the ocean floor upwards some seventy meters through the rock, leaving a jagged scar in its wake.

Colorful buildings hang from the cove's ceiling, shaped like birdcages with circular flat bottoms and domed tops. Sturdy wooden bridges serve as walkways connecting the buildings, some with intricate carvings along the railings. Some of the less extravagant buildings are are bolted to the rocky surface of the coves walls, with narrow stairs and creaking lifts to carry goods from the ships docked below.

Notable landmark: The Fairwind Guild Hall sits at the wedge's deepest point, carved directly from the stone. It features three diamond-shaped buildings stacked atop one another, each smaller than the last. The smallest, at the base, serves as the main entrance.

Hook to interest players: Despite the cove's affluent clientele, a rougher crowd lingers around the shops. There's an undercurrent of tension, the people of the cove seeming afraid and on edge. Players who investigate may uncover a pirate captain working with one of the crooked merchants, his crew quietly scouting the cove's defenses in preparation for a daring raid.

### Azure Grove 

A druid grove on the rocky ocean shore. Fields of blue grass lead to a collection of tide pools filled with colorful creatures and sea foam-colored algae. The druids live in huts among the blue grass made with reeds from a nearby estuary. They derive healing remedies from the algae in the tide pools and trade them with a local fishing village. In exchange, the village ensures that the corals are not over fished.

Notable landmark: the crystal blue waters reveal a beautiful rainbow forest of coral beneath the ocean's surface. Other than that, it is a modest, unremarkable area, easy to pass by without notice.

Hooks to interest players: There could be a problem with the algae, a sickness of some kind poisoning the tide pools and spreading along the shore. If you don't have a party equipped for dealing with sickness or infections in nature, you could keep it simple with damage being done to the coral from a rabid monster shark or even a greedy diver.

### Ruins of the Dawning Citadel

A once prosperous citadel of magic users, primarily sorcerers, that worked for the prosperity and advancement of all living things. One of the few places that openly welcomed the magical study of death and afterlife, the citadel attracted many well to do necromancers and a few unsavory types that hid their intentions well enough to go unnoticed. One such necromancer had an experiment go wrong which resulted in the entire citadel being pulled into a mass grave in the earth, burying it in ruins and killing all within. The ruins are filled with the decaying corpses of the inhabitants, preserved in the aftershocks of the necromancers failed experiment but kept dormant by the artifact the necromancer had been experimenting on. Improper removal of said artifact from the citadel would result in an army of 10,000 mindless undead with no directive except to kill.
- The skeletons all grow various strengths of [[Items-and-Vegetations#^031498|Intellite]].
- This is meant to be a place for players to find after hearing rumors of it's location and/or stumbling blindly upon it and thus has no hooks.

### Blitelands

A desecrated patch of land where a sect of paladins waged war on a group of Death cultists and infernal beings. When victory for the paladins was clear, Death's chosen champion cursed the land with eternal decay, killing everyone on the battlefield.
- A tall, pristine white tower is situated in the very center of the land, with blue glass windows making up the spiral tipped dome. Within the tower prowls the spirit of the paladins leader, [[Characters#Doxthor Shieldfang|Doxthor Shieldfang]], keeping vigil over the land.
- Most paladins know of this location and some choose to make a pilgrimage and pay their respects, regardless of their order or deity.
- I created this location as one of three made specifically for players in one of my campaigns, so the hook ties into the backstory of one of those players.

### Nightdust Desert

Desert of black sand with crystal-like plants that glow when the moon is full
The days are frigidly cold, despite the hot sun and the nights are pleasantly balmy. 

Two settlements are here, one of which is a tribal village of snake-people who worship the moon. Being cold blooded, this makes being predominantly nocturnal a challenge for the younger snakes. The elders are fully nocturnal and draw power from the moonstones mined in the rocky areas of the desert. The other settlement is newer and smaller, a group of researchers who have made a home here studying the strange crystal plants that seem to grow with the light of the moon. The two settlements do not interact.

### Howling Fjords

A land of ice at the top of the continent. Beneath the ice is a cave system with a central cavern that is the final resting place of [[Characters#Lucian Icebane|Lucian Icebane]]. He stands perpetually frozen in the center, brandishing his legendary forked sword [[Items-and-Vegetations#^3ba6fe|Serpent Tongue]]. Curling around his statue is the frozen form of [[Characters#Oraxis|Oraxis]], an Ice Dragon and the last of the dragons on this plane of existence.
-->
### Nether Isles

A collection of mysterious islands that recently sprang into existence. There are five total, each completely unique and housing an item of rare value. The appearance of the islands coincides with the disappearance of [[Characters#Lhoris|Lhoris]] from Motlier, as he is responsible for hiding the items on the islands. However, his unstable magic caused the influence of the items to spread and infect the land around them, which is why each island reflects the item it houses in some way.
- Shattered Bog
	- A marshy bog criss crossed with green, slimy waters, giving the land its shattered look. It's the only island inhabited by intelligent life, with swamp hags forming from the bog waters itself. The artifact is known as Mossmire Staff, a gnarled staff covered in moss that seeps with slimy, putrid smelling acid from the three rounded knots at the top.
- Planar Beach
	- An endless beach full of strange planar rifts that cause unpredictable events the closer one gets to the artifact. The fabric of reality bends and shifts, causing the existence of other planes to bleed into the one on the beach. The item is known as the Ethereal Gaze, a set of glasses that allows the wearer to see across large distances, into other planes and even through objects, but only one at a time.
- Crystal Mountain
	- A tall mountain with cave entrance at the very top. The entire inside of the mountain is made of multihued crystals, with a stairway circling down the mountains center leading to the artifact. The artifact is known as the Ring of Prismorphism, a ring of crystal that grows into a thin but hard armor shell around the body.
- Blueglow Jungle
	- Bioluminescent jungle full of glowing plant and wildlife. The island is pitch black otherwise, making the plants and creatures appear to exist in an inky void. The artifact is known as the Lumismic, a glass prism that houses a cloud of luminescent mist. It can change colors and form rudimentary shapes within based off of the desires of the wielder. Its light shines in all forms of darkness.
- Fearspire
	- An imposing tower seemingly made out of darkness itself rising from the water. The waters around the water are perfectly still, devoid of current and covered in a thick, grey fog. Anyone attempting to get to the island without the artifacts from the other islands will continuously be turned around and unable to reach the spire. The Fearspire houses an illusionary double of [[Characters#Lhoris|Lhoris]], instructed to give the players [[Items-and-Vegetations#^cc2787|Naruvi's Orb]] and reveal his location.

## Homebrew Campaign Locations

The following are notes on locations I have used in my 5th Edition D&D Homebrew campaign. You can find the narrative design document for the campaign [[Example-Flow|here]].
<!--
### Motlier

*A quick forward on Motlier: Motlier started as a town for my larger campaign and eventually I spent a little more time with it and turned it into a fully fleshed out town that a DM could add to their campaign with a One-Shot for those days when you just need some buffer. It can be found [[Motlier-One-Off|here]].*

Motlier is a lumber town in the Stormsong Peaks, providing timber and building materials to the nearby cities of Fairhaven and Caidour in exchange for Caidour's minerals/ore and Fairhaven crops.

### Fairhaven

A farming settlement at the base of the Stormsong Peaks, blessed by The Great Mother. The farm land yields crops that make it through even the harshest of winters and droughts and never suffer from any sort of infestation or disease. Anything that is planted will grow in abundance all the way to the borders of the town.

One of the most notable parts of Fairhaven is the lush thicket that grows along the northern borders. Rich, sweet blackberries the size of a babies fists grow in abundance among the thicket. Kore uses this to produce a sweet berry mead that is highly sought after in cities around the continent.
- The Wanton Minstrel
	- A modest adventurer's tavern, managed by a retired adventuring couple who play music every night.
		- Kore will request a fresh carcass of meat be brought to the outskirts of town in exchange for free food and lodging. She won't say why.
		- Percy wants some herbs found near a kobold camp to preform a ritual to renew their soil, is willing to pay 5 gold or permanent free drinks/lodging at the inn
			- Kobold camp is near the "abandoned" Fort Walker, and was made by Yara to catch any unwanted visitors. Kobolds are 50/50 on their loyalty to The Violet Ravens
- Sabenn's Masonry
	- The workshop of a female human stonemason named Sabenn, known for her weirdly specific knowledge of giants.
	- Wants to live in Caidour studying the rare ore mined from the Stormsong Peaks but was denied due to her elvish features
	- Sabenn will speak of the remnants of a giant village in the far north. If players show interest, she'll mention some runes depicting a story that she couldn't decipher. It's a sore spot for her.
	- Will mention that she thought to ask someone named [[Yara]] to help her get the job in Caidour but decided she wants to be let in on her merits or not at all. She met [[Yara]] near the old, "abandoned" Fort Walker
- Boltrof Estate
	- Large farmhouse where [[Boltrof]] lives
	- [[Boltrof]] will request the players take a missive to Caidour requesting the presence of one of their mages to asses the farm grounds, and informing them of bandits attacking merchants and stealing goods along the roads
- Fairhaven Farming Grounds
	- Farm run primarily by [[Thomas]] and his boy [[Henry]]
	- Is currently struggling as the soil is infested with a black, slime type substance

### Caidour

Caidour is a large mining town built into the Stormsong Peaks that leads into the Gwallian Pass. It is governed by a council made up of the heads of two noble families, the foreman who oversees the mines, the head of trade, the regions mage and two members of the Golden Owl Merchants guild. All important matters happening at the base of the Stormsong Peaks are overheard and ruled upon by the council. They also oversee the economic growth of the region, and control the exports and imports of goods through the Gwallian Pass
- The House of Coprasos is a large timber and brick theater, known for its week-long Dwarven epics. It's a big attraction during the Solstice Festivals and draws a large crowd from all over the southern half of the continent.
- Iron Woman Armorer is a shop that makes custom armor that is both functional and fashionable. It is run by an old, retired character of mine named [[Characters#Azaela|Azaela]].
- Celestial Hammers is a blacksmith shop run by [[Ugmal]], who is a retired paladin.
- The Drunken Pick is a Tavern in central district geared towards travelers and merchants, run by [[Thallda]], who is very short with people.
    - Has a monopoly on Black Diamond Ale
- Black Diamond Brewery produces the elusive Black Diamond Ale, a highly addictive and intoxicating brew created by [[Gredga]]
    - [[Gredga]] puts powdered mushrooms that grow deep into the forbidden caverns into her ale, which gives it the addictive quality. Recently she's been experimenting with the multi-colored mushrooms that have begun sprouting in the caverns, which means any magic users that drink a new brew will find themselves magically impotent while the ale is in their system.
- Sleepy Miners Inn is the other major competitor for Inns, boasting better rooms and nicer beds but not as good food, and especially bad ale. Run by [[Notch]]
    - [[Notch]] will request players somehow secure him cask of [[Gredga]]'s Black Diamond Ale. He doesn't care what has to be done, and is willing to turn a blind eye to any mischief as long as he gets a crate of the ale OR the recipe.
- Tinker Tricks and Curiosities is a shop of strange artifacts, toys, and general curiosities by [[Bumela]], a human mage who loves strange things.

### Temple of Alva

Hidden in the cavern beneath the ruins in Motlier behind a illusory wall. The temple, untouched by time, everything pristine with not a spec of dust or dirt. Two braziers glow with a white fire that offers no heat. On the wall is a large mural that depicts a woman wrapped in robes flowing down from the moon on her left and the sun on her right. Her arms extend outward, each hand hovering under the depictions of sun and moon as if to weigh their importance in her grasp. A small alter rests at her feet, in between the dual brazers. The stone atop the alter glows faintly with a blue light.

### Glistening Shallows

A set of six legendary hot springs across the continent. Each hot spring has a three to four story tall white stone tower where a sect of monks live and tend to the springs. The waters of the springs have the ability to cleanse all magic from whatever baths within it, including items one might wear. The monks guard the springs fiercely, but also will allow those who are truly good in their heart and in great need to rest in the waters.

<!--
### Fort Walker

A once abandoned fortress consisting of four towers connected by walls, a narrow main building, and a courtyard. The walls are patrolled and the windows of the towers usually have a set of two archers, one at the higher window, one at the lower. The fort, presumed to be abandoned, is home to a local contingent of the Violet Ravens. Fort Walker is one of many such forts across the continent, all housing a different contingent of the Violet Ravens.

## Novel Locations

*Below are a few locations I've created for my novels.*
### Fleece

A nomadic town of thieves and outlaws in the Farwood, run by an old, retired mercenary named Cain. It consists mostly of about ten to twenty residents half of which remain in the camp. After the start of the war with King Cairac, Fleece grows rather large as it doubles as a camp for refugees fleeing from the war. Given it's size, it would be impossible to hide without the use of fey runes placed by a Shadow named Ashier. The runes hide the noise and sight of the camp. Any who step into the borders of the camp without accompaniment of Ashier is teleported to the other side of the camp. 

### Tree of Duality

Two trees that sprouted from the single seed of the world. The tree grew to cover the world, a network of roots criss crossing across the entire planet. The trees began as the same sprout, separating at the trunk as they grew before rejoining into a single tree in a tangle of branches at the top. This forms a perfect circle in the center, which is where the First Oraci draws forth Shades as well as her fellow sister Oraci. The trees themselves are a representation of the balance in the world, the left tree a pristine white bark, smooth like marble with golden, smooth edged leaves. The right side is jet black with rough bark and gnarled knots, with silver three pronged leaves with serrated edges.

### Whitebark Bog

Whitebark Bog is a dangerous area on the South Western edge of the Farwood. It's filled with perpetual white fog and has a disorienting air to it. What little plant life grows consists of spindly thorny trees, devoid of leaves with a smooth white bark. It is said that those who venture too close to the bog are drawn in by ghosts of lovers long past, tortured with watching their pale visage always just out of reach.
