*A list of notable locations I have made for Game Masters to drop into their world. These include a name and layout description, and a few other bits such as economic use, interesting landmarks and notable shops. Any that I've made for a campaign also include hooks to interest players into sticking around and exploring.*

## Regional Wonders
### Wedgerock Cove

Wedgerock Cove is a bustling trading hub, home to the Fairwind Merchants’ Guildhall—a collective of tradesmen and ship captains dealing in luxury goods like silks, spices, and fine jewels. While most of the cove's inhabitants are upstanding citizens, a few crooked merchants have found their way into the guild's officers' positions. Hidden among the silks and spices, forbidden goods and insidious secrets flow through the cove unnoticed. Tensions simmer beneath the cove's polished surface, and the residents are beginning to feel the unsavory nature of such deals threatening their luxuries.

The layout of the cove is one of the continent’s most intriguing feats of natural architecture. It forms an inverted wedge along the eastern coastline, as if some monstrous force had ripped the ocean floor upwards some seventy meters through the rock, leaving a jagged scar in its wake.

Colorful buildings hang from the cove's ceiling, shaped like birdcages with circular flat bottoms and domed tops. The smell of ocean brine mingles with the rich scent of spices from the trade ports below. Sturdy wooden bridges serve as walkways connecting the buildings, the once intricate carvings worn down from the humid wind. Some of the less extravagant buildings are bolted to the rocky surface of the cove's walls, with narrow stairs and creaking lifts to carry goods from the ships docked below.

Notable Landmark: Carved directly from the stone in the deepest part of the wedge, the Fairwind Merchants' Guildhall is an intriguing feat of architecture. Curiously monolithic compared to the rest of the cove's colorful structures, it serves as both the main office and bank for all of its merchants. Three interlocking diamond-shaped buildings varied in size are cut from the stone, the smallest of which is at the base. Serving as the main entrance, the lower floor contains nothing more than a desk and a single gatekeeper. If one can prove their worth, by rank or by coin, they may travel up to the higher levels whose sizes are reflective of their importance.

Hook for GMs: Despite the cove’s affluent clientele, a rougher crowd lingers around the shops. The sharp scent of fear hangs in the salty air, and the people of the cove nervously avoid the players' eyes. A pirate captain working with one of the crooked merchants plots in a ship anchored further along the shore, his crew quietly scouting the cove’s defenses in preparation for a daring raid.

### Azure Grove 

Azure Grove is a serene oasis along the rocky ocean shore. Fields of blue grass grow among the sand, broken up by tide pools filled with colorful creatures. The cool ocean breeze brings lazy waves to lap at the shore, carrying sea foam-colored algae. The druids live in huts among the blue grass made with reeds from a nearby estuary. They derive healing remedies from the algae in the tide pools and trade them with a local fishing village. In exchange, the village ensures that the corals are not overfished.

Notable Landmark: The grove appears no different from any other at first glance. Only those who gain the village's trust are allowed to see the true beauty the druids protect: a brilliant forest of rainbow coral thriving beneath the ocean's surface, and home to some species unknown to the rest of the realm.

Hook for GMs: A sickness seeps through the reef, painting the algae with an oil-slick opalescence. This was no mere act of nature. Someone, or *something*, has poisoned the grove, spreading a sickness that suspiciously only affects the druids.

### Ruins of the Dawning Citadel

Buried deep in the earth and kept away from the harsh duality of morals, the Dawning Citadel is one of the few places where all studies of the arcane were encouraged. A place of great scientific advancement, the citadel attracted any and all people who sought the betterment of the world through their experiments. The citadel's blurred morals made it a haven for necromancers. Most came driven by a hunger for knowledge, but a select few harbored darker urges. One such necromancer hid his motives just long enough for his experiment to go horribly wrong.

In a single explosion of necrotic magic, the entire citadel was buried in a mass grave, ripping the souls from the inhabitants and trapping them in a single gem. The ruins are filled with tens of thousands of slowly decaying corpses, preserved in eerie detail in the exact moment of their death. Trapped in the aftershocks of the necromancer's failed experiment, their eyes follow the players as they move through the citadel. The only thing keeping the horde at bay is a counter artifact hidden somewhere in the citadel. A simple lantern crafted by a holy cleric to keep the darkness contained.

Because of the unstable nature of the curse still rippling through the citadel, players must use extreme caution if they wish to remove either artifact. If the lantern goes dark, or the gem is removed before being purified, an army of mindless undead would be freed, driven by a single directive: kill.

Notable Landmark: Once a masterful blend of Dwarven masonry and scholastic ingenuity, the Dawning Citadel now lies in ruin. Its once grand halls and carved towers have crumbled into hollow echoes of the citadel's former glory. Only two wonders remain: the ten thousand corpses of the citadel's powerful inhabitants, and the strange crystals jutting from their skulls.

Hook for GMs: Whispers coil through the magic circles of the surface: the ruins of the Dawning Citadel have been found. No proof, just tales. But to those who listen closely, tales can become trails. And riches are never free.

### Blitelands

Along the far, eastern edge of the continent stands a single, gleaming tower among a ravaged land. Once home to an order of paladins, the Blitelands are the desecrated remains of their war against Death's cult. Though the paladins won the battle, Death struck the final blow. In an act of spite, his Champion cursed the land to rot in a state of eternal decay. The entire order fell, the land forever fetid with the festering corpses of both sides. Only the tower remains, a beacon of light among a blighted land.

It is a place of pilgrimage for paladins, where oaths are tested against the tragic cost of holy wars. Those who survive the land's corrupting touch and hold fast to their vows are granted an audience with the ghostly specter of Doxthor Shieldfang, head of the paladin order. He remains trapped within the tower, willingly forsaking the afterlife in order to bind his soul to the tainted land.

Ever the paladin, Doxthor sacrificed his soul to keep the blight contained, forever a lone sentinel guarding the realm from death.

Notable Landmark: Standing tall at the center of the Blitelands is the last remaining structure of the Shieldfang Keep. Walls crumble on either side of the base, the only evidence that there was ever more to this singular tower. Pristine white stone rises high and unbroken, topped with a cone of glass. Blue and green mosaic art depict the order's Coat of Arms as well as the holy symbol for the Goddess they serve.

Hook for GMs: Recent reports from the holy cities across the continent all share a disturbing fact: paladins have not been returning from their pilgrimage. The weaker of the orders have been known to forsake their oaths when confronted with the true cost of war. However, ripples of unease begin to spread through the veterans of the order when even the truest of souls don't return. Frantic generals fear the blight grows stronger while the braver youth confront the unthinkable: Is the danger the guardian within?

### Nightdust Desert

Spread across a vast swath of the southern shore, the Nightdust Desert glitters with sand black as night. Strange crystalline plants cut through the midnight dunes, glowing hands stretched out in silent worship. When one is touched, the rest begin to hum with a pure melody that echoes across the landscape. The days are frigid, despite the hot sun beating down on the land. The nights, however, are temperate and balmy, warmed by the strange breath of the desert's living flora.

Two settlements inhabit this alien landscape, living in an uneasy harmony. The first is a tribal sect of Lizardfolk. Worshipers of the moon, they live in communal burrows beneath the sands during the day to preserve their warmth, only emerging once the sun has set. Due to their cold-blooded nature, the young struggle with the fully nocturnal habits of the clan. They spend the nights sifting the sands for moonstones in the rockier parts of the desert near the shore.

The second settlement is new to the desert, erecting a small base on the surface. Made up entirely of researchers, this group has come to study the strange structure of the plant life. The expedition was funded by a retired adventurer, who in his old age has become obsessed with the idea of a keep spun from the rarest materials in the realm.

No matter the cost.

Notable Landmark: Among the desert's crystalline plant life, one tree stands out. Its size and shape are unremarkable, but the strange offerings adorning it draw curious eyes. Silvery scales hang from the branches, clinking faintly in the warm, night-born breeze.

Hook for GMs: Despite their mundane appearance, arcanists among the researchers believe the stones in the Nightdust Desert hold more than spiritual significance. They amplify magic in wondrous yet unpredictable ways. The other researchers urge caution, for the local tribe does not suffer those who abuse the gifts of the moon.

### Howling Fjords

A land of ice at the top of the continent. Beneath the ice is a cave system with a central cavern that is the final resting place of [[Characters#Lucian Icebane|Lucian Icebane]]. He stands perpetually frozen in the center, brandishing his legendary forked sword [[Items-and-Vegetations#^3ba6fe|Serpent Tongue]]. Curling around his statue is the frozen form of [[Characters#Oraxis|Oraxis]], an Ice Dragon and the last of the dragons on this plane of existence.
-->
### Nether Isles

A collection of mysterious islands that recently sprang into existence. There are five total, each completely unique and housing an item of rare value. The appearance of the islands coincides with the disappearance of [[Characters#Lhoris|Lhoris]] from Motlier, as he is responsible for hiding the items on the islands. However, his unstable magic caused the influence of the items to spread and infect the land around them, which is why each island reflects the item it houses in some way.
- Shattered Bog
	- A marshy bog criss crossed with green, slimy waters, giving the land its shattered look. It's the only island inhabited by intelligent life, with swamp hags forming from the bog waters itself. The artifact is known as Mossmire Staff, a gnarled staff covered in moss that seeps with slimy, putrid smelling acid from the three rounded knots at the top.
- Planar Beach
	- An endless beach full of strange planar rifts that cause unpredictable events the closer one gets to the artifact. The fabric of reality bends and shifts, causing the existence of other planes to bleed into the one on the beach. The item is known as the Ethereal Gaze, a set of glasses that allows the wearer to see across large distances, into other planes and even through objects, but only one at a time.
- Crystal Mountain
	- A tall mountain with cave entrance at the very top. The entire inside of the mountain is made of multihued crystals, with a stairway circling down the mountains center leading to the artifact. The artifact is known as the Ring of Prismorphism, a ring of crystal that grows into a thin but hard armor shell around the body.
- Blueglow Jungle
	- Bioluminescent jungle full of glowing plant and wildlife. The island is pitch black otherwise, making the plants and creatures appear to exist in an inky void. The artifact is known as the Lumismic, a glass prism that houses a cloud of luminescent mist. It can change colors and form rudimentary shapes within based off of the desires of the wielder. Its light shines in all forms of darkness.
- Fearspire
	- An imposing tower seemingly made out of darkness itself rising from the water. The waters around the water are perfectly still, devoid of current and covered in a thick, grey fog. Anyone attempting to get to the island without the artifacts from the other islands will continuously be turned around and unable to reach the spire. The Fearspire houses an illusionary double of [[Characters#Lhoris|Lhoris]], instructed to give the players [[Items-and-Vegetations#^cc2787|Naruvi's Orb]] and reveal his location.

## Homebrew Campaign Locations

The following are notes on locations I have used in my 5th Edition D&D Homebrew campaign. You can find the narrative design document for the campaign [[Example-Flow|here]].
<!--
### Motlier

*A quick forward on Motlier: Motlier started as a town for my larger campaign and eventually I spent a little more time with it and turned it into a fully fleshed out town that a DM could add to their campaign with a One-Shot for those days when you just need some buffer. It can be found [[Motlier-One-Off|here]].*

### Fairhaven

A farming settlement at the base of the Stormsong Peaks, blessed by The Great Mother. The farm land yields crops that make it through even the harshest of winters and droughts and never suffer from any sort of infestation or disease. Anything that is planted will grow in abundance all the way to the borders of the town.

One of the most notable parts of Fairhaven is the lush thicket that grows along the northern borders. Rich, sweet blackberries the size of a babies fists grow in abundance among the thicket. Kore uses this to produce a sweet berry mead that is highly sought after in cities around the continent.
- The Wanton Minstrel
	- A modest adventurer's tavern, managed by a retired adventuring couple who play music every night.
		- Kore will request a fresh carcass of meat be brought to the outskirts of town in exchange for free food and lodging. She won't say why.
		- Percy wants some herbs found near a kobold camp to preform a ritual to renew their soil, is willing to pay 5 gold or permanent free drinks/lodging at the inn
			- Kobold camp is near the "abandoned" Fort Walker, and was made by Yara to catch any unwanted visitors. Kobolds are 50/50 on their loyalty to The Violet Ravens
- Sabenn's Masonry
	- The workshop of a female human stonemason named Sabenn, known for her weirdly specific knowledge of giants.
	- Wants to live in Caidour studying the rare ore mined from the Stormsong Peaks but was denied due to her elvish features
	- Sabenn will speak of the remnants of a giant village in the far north. If players show interest, she'll mention some runes depicting a story that she couldn't decipher. It's a sore spot for her.
	- Will mention that she thought to ask someone named [[Yara]] to help her get the job in Caidour but decided she wants to be let in on her merits or not at all. She met [[Yara]] near the old, "abandoned" Fort Walker
- Boltrof Estate
	- Large farmhouse where [[Boltrof]] lives
	- [[Boltrof]] will request the players take a missive to Caidour requesting the presence of one of their mages to asses the farm grounds, and informing them of bandits attacking merchants and stealing goods along the roads

	- Farm run primarily by [[Thomas]] and his boy [[Henry]]
	- Is currently struggling as the soil is infested with a black, slime type substance
-->

### Caidour

Caidour is a large mining town built into the Stormsong Peaks that leads into the Gwallian Pass. It is governed by a council made up of the heads of two noble families, the foreman who oversees the mines, the head of trade, the regions mage and two members of the Golden Owl Merchants guild. All important matters happening at the base of the Stormsong Peaks are overheard and ruled upon by the council. They also oversee the economic growth of the region, and control the exports and imports of goods through the Gwallian Pass
- The House of Coprasos is a large timber and brick theater, known for its week-long Dwarven epics. It's a big attraction during the Solstice Festivals and draws a large crowd from all over the southern half of the continent.
- Iron Woman Armorer is a shop that makes custom armor that is both functional and fashionable. It is run by an old, retired character of mine named [[Characters#Azaela|Azaela]].
- Celestial Hammers is a blacksmith shop run by [[Ugmal]], who is a retired paladin.
- The Drunken Pick is a Tavern in central district geared towards travelers and merchants, run by [[Thallda]], who is very short with people.
    - Has a monopoly on Black Diamond Ale
- Black Diamond Brewery produces the elusive Black Diamond Ale, a highly addictive and intoxicating brew created by [[Gredga]]
    - [[Gredga]] puts powdered mushrooms that grow deep into the forbidden caverns into her ale, which gives it the addictive quality. Recently she's been experimenting with the multi-colored mushrooms that have begun sprouting in the caverns, which means any magic users that drink a new brew will find themselves magically impotent while the ale is in their system.
- Sleepy Miners Inn is the other major competitor for Inns, boasting better rooms and nicer beds but not as good food, and especially bad ale. Run by [[Notch]]
    - [[Notch]] will request players somehow secure him cask of [[Gredga]]'s Black Diamond Ale. He doesn't care what has to be done, and is willing to turn a blind eye to any mischief as long as he gets a crate of the ale OR the recipe.
- Tinker Tricks and Curiosities is a shop of strange artifacts, toys, and general curiosities by [[Bumela]], a human mage who loves strange things.

### Temple of Alva

Hidden in the cavern beneath the ruins in Motlier behind a illusory wall. The temple, untouched by time, everything pristine with not a spec of dust or dirt. Two braziers glow with a white fire that offers no heat. On the wall is a large mural that depicts a woman wrapped in robes flowing down from the moon on her left and the sun on her right. Her arms extend outward, each hand hovering under the depictions of sun and moon as if to weigh their importance in her grasp. A small alter rests at her feet, in between the dual brazers. The stone atop the alter glows faintly with a blue light.

### Glistening Shallows

A set of six legendary hot springs across the continent. Each hot spring has a three to four story tall white stone tower where a sect of monks live and tend to the springs. The waters of the springs have the ability to cleanse all magic from whatever baths within it, including items one might wear. The monks guard the springs fiercely, but also will allow those who are truly good in their heart and in great need to rest in the waters.

<!--
### Fort Walker

A once abandoned fortress consisting of four towers connected by walls, a narrow main building, and a courtyard. The walls are patrolled and the windows of the towers usually have a set of two archers, one at the higher window, one at the lower. The fort, presumed to be abandoned, is home to a local contingent of the Violet Ravens. Fort Walker is one of many such forts across the continent, all housing a different contingent of the Violet Ravens.
-->

## Novel Locations

*Below are a few locations I've created for my novels.*
### Fleece

A nomadic town of thieves and outlaws in the Farwood, run by an old, retired mercenary named Cain. It consists mostly of about ten to twenty residents half of which remain in the camp. After the start of the war with King Cairac, Fleece grows rather large as it doubles as a camp for refugees fleeing from the war. Given it's size, it would be impossible to hide without the use of fey runes placed by a Shadow named Ashier. The runes hide the noise and sight of the camp. Any who step into the borders of the camp without accompaniment of Ashier is teleported to the other side of the camp. 

### Tree of Duality

Two trees that sprouted from the single seed of the world. The tree grew to cover the world, a network of roots criss crossing across the entire planet. The trees began as the same sprout, separating at the trunk as they grew before rejoining into a single tree in a tangle of branches at the top. This forms a perfect circle in the center, which is where the First Oraci draws forth Shades as well as her fellow sister Oraci. The trees themselves are a representation of the balance in the world, the left tree a pristine white bark, smooth like marble with golden, smooth edged leaves. The right side is jet black with rough bark and gnarled knots, with silver three pronged leaves with serrated edges.

### Whitebark Bog

Whitebark Bog is a dangerous area on the South Western edge of the Farwood. It's filled with perpetual white fog and has a disorienting air to it. What little plant life grows consists of spindly thorny trees, devoid of leaves with a smooth white bark. It is said that those who venture too close to the bog are drawn in by ghosts of lovers long past, tortured with watching their pale visage always just out of reach.
