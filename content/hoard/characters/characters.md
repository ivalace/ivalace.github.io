### Azaela

Azaela is a Tiefling who was born blind on the streets of a coastal town. She was abandoned on the steps of an orphanage, but because of her infernal blood she was discarded and left for dead. Despite this, she was taken in by another Tiefling who ran a small thieving operation with others of their kind. She learned to rely on her other senses and became quite the charlatan, alternating between pickpocketing and conning wealthy nobles out of their accessories by hustling them with her blindness. Eventually, she managed to pilfer a ring that housed a genie. In exchange for sight, she promised to fulfill the genie's every wish. As an adult now, she runs a shop that specializes in extravagant and beautiful adventuring gear. Obsessed with all things colorful and shiny, she enjoys making practical adventuring armor and accessories that don't sacrifice fashion for usability.

Her most important and precious possession is the goggles gifted by the genie that allow her to see. These are fitted to her by leather straps around the back of her head. Bronze metal frames house magenta colored glass that is about an inch thick and mirrored, obscuring her eyes underneath. She is still blind underneath the goggles, and therefore never takes them off, even in sleep. Given her extravagant and extremely eccentric fashion style, most people chalk it up to her simply being strange.

She carries a belt around the waist and a sash across her chest that contains several spools of thread in various colors and vials of dye. A pouch of needles in various sizes sits where the hilt of a dagger would rest. Her gloves are tipped in shiny metal claws painted a bright shade of yellow mixed with flecks of gold foil. Her [[Items-and-Vegetations#^40dd61|traveling boots]] have a stiletto heel that folds upwards into the sole of the shoe in order to make traversing difficult terrain easier. She repurposed the ring that holds the genie into an earring that hangs from her left ear, along with several other dangling chains and a few spiked rings. Her other ear sports an earring made from a baby owlbear's feather. She refuses to speak of how she got such a feather.

She's a Tiefling of the Fierna Bloodline. Her skin is a bright red, crisscrossed with some scars along her hands. She has two large wings that she likes to have painted whenever she can. Her hair is thick and curly, kept short and colored deep purple. She likes to weave colorful threads into the curls whenever she's in the mood for something different.

### Madam Rosemary

Madam Rosemary is a [[Races-Creatures-Classes#Dream Walker|Dream Walker]], able to see and act as a guide the dreams of people. As she hums, she weaves a tapestry of the dreams she sees. She can help clarify the parties path and in doing so builds an unfinished tapestry of a misleading future.

Madam Rosemary is an elder of her race. She is very thin and willowy of frame, with pin-straight, waist length raven black hair streaked with long, grey strands. She has large, lidless silver eyes as is normal for her race. She tends to wear very loose fitting robes woven in dark, midnight blue.

### Doxthor Shieldfang

Leader of a paladin order, he hails from the Shieldfang pride. After giving his body in defense of the realm, his spirit was left behind to hold vigil over the [[Locations#Blitelands|Blitelands]]. There his spirit will remain, trapped in an eternal struggle to keep the blight from covering the world.

Doxthor is a Lion Kin with fur a russet tan and a mane heavily adorned with braids and beads. His eyes are a piercing blue with gold around the pupils. His armor was standard order for his paladins, with the exception of the Shieldfang clan emblem painted onto his breastplate and shield in royal blue.

### Lucian Icebane

Lucian Icebane is a legendary hero known throughout the land as a banisher of dragons. He was last seen venturing into the [[Locations#Howling Fjords|Howling Fjords]] to face down Oraxis and no one has seen him since. Those who venture after him can find his tomb and learn from the inscription at his feet that gave his life to trap Oraxis in his own ice to keep him from freezing the world. Before this, he opened a portal to another plane using his sword [[Items-and-Vegetations#^3ba6fe|Serpent Tongue]], banishing the last of the dragons of the realm into it. The plane is now home to every dragon except Oraxis, and can only be opened with the [[Items-and-Vegetations#^3ba6fe|Serpent Tongue]].

*The following three are additions made for the larger campaign that [[Locations#Motlier|Motlier]] was originally made for.*
### Julie Starchild

 Sweet, lovely Julie is the only permanent resident of the town who has no ties to it. An orphan, discovered as a baby abandoned in the middle of town square, she was raised by the entire town and is seen to all as a daughter. She grew up primarily staying with Robert and Wilmetta at [[Locations#^37acc0|Blade and Twine]] learning to cook. She loves gardening and is scared of outsiders, despite her insatiable curiosity of the outside world. Upon reaching adulthood, she took a job at [[Locations#^90781b|Boars Head Tavern]] as the cook when Boris's wife died. She is a natural born healer, something that comes out in her cooking. Her food holds a soothing element to it which is the product of her innate magic. When Lhoris makes an appearance in town, the two of them connect and she ends up falling deeply in love with him.

Unbeknownst to her, she Is the daughter of The Mother, making her a demigod and a born druid. When The Mother was cast down into her slumber, she sent her only true daughter to a place where she could live in peace, hidden away from the gods.

### Lhoris 

 Lhoris is a former wood elf cleric of The Mother turned Sorcerer, currently residing in [[Locations#Motlier|Motlier]] searching for the [[Locations#Temple of Alva|Temple of Alva]]. He was exiled from his home and his family after unwittingly being a pawn of Xeton's to cast down The Mother. Cursed with maddening power that gets worse with every season, he was made immortal by Zokar and forced to wander the continent seeking out magical artifacts and beings. Once had the Maw of Zokar (a brand given to those who serve the Insatiable being) on his left shoulder, which allowed Xeton to track him. His father spent the last of his strength cleansing his flesh and thus removing the mark before tasking him to find Alva and convince her to restore balance to the land. His search led him to [[Locations#Motlier|Motlier]], where he was investigating the ruins near the village. There, he fell in love with Julie Starchild and now hunts her and therefore Xeton to get her back.

### Zokar

Zokar is a myconid who is plagued by a never ending hunger for magical essence. He consumed large swaths of the Underdark, eventually spreading his influences to the surface. Denizens of the Underdark mostly avoid his domain, but a few have gathered to him in order to serve his greed. The original four that serve him are known as his apostles and each have something they hope to gain from aiding in his ascension.

Zokar is a giant myconid of brilliant, prismatic coloring with a low stem and a large multi-layered crown. The bubbly mass of his crown grows larger the more he consumes, releasing more of his spores into both the Underdark and across the surface. He does not feel that what he is doing is either good nor bad, simply a necessity of his ever growing hunger. As he grows closer to his goal of becoming the God of Gluttony, his influence on those infected with his spores grows as well.

## Novel Characters

*Below is a description of the main character for my novel Of Shadows Sight*
### Aelyth

Aelyth is a child of prophecy, raised as a human in a human family. Her appearance is normal with long deep brown hair and brown eyes with rounded ears. Despite the human appearance, she is a daughter of the Mother Oracle and the First Shade. Born specifically to fulfill the Oraci's final prophecy she was blessed with heightened senses and a natural affinity for battle. She also heals unnaturally quick and seems to escape most scrapes with minimal injuries. On her eighteenth birthday, she comes fully into her birthright and develops her Deathsight and Shadowstep.
- Deathsight is the power to experience her death a moment before it happens in a vision. The world bleeds of color and turns grey, and she experiences her death in a moment suspended from time. The world slows, allowing her to take in details until eventually she draws her last breath. The vision ends on her next inhale, the world rushing back into focus a second before what happens in the vision. This gives her the ability to avoid death at the last second.
- Shadowstep is the power to call upon darkness and bring it to her, wrapping herself with it and disappearing completely. She leaves no footprints, makes no sound, and can maintain the darkness until she drops it.
