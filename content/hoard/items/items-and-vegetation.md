## Items

### Poisoned Gauntlets

Gauntlets with clawed fingertips that contain a vial of poison in each metal tip. With enough pressure, the poison released through a tiny hole into the victim's skin. Vials contain an intense concentration and only release a few drops into the victim with each attack. Vials do need to be refilled when emptied.

### Skull Barrels

Barrels with a skull on top, these barrels contain the remains of a person trapped inside with a necrotizing substance. Break the barrels and a skeleton covered in purple goo will emerge and begin attacking everything around it until the purple goo dissipates and it dies.

<!--
### Serpents Tongue ^3ba6fe

The whispering sword of [[Characters#Lucian Icebane|Lucian Icebane]], who defeated the Dragon Lord and tamed the dragons, driving them into another plane to end the dragon wars. Is the only key to opening a portal into that realm and no other mortal has ever entered the Dragon Planes. Those who speak draconic or have ties to dragon kind can hear the faint whispering of Lucian's warnings on the havoc dragons could wreak mixed with the spell needed to open the portal spoken in a deep rumbling voice of the Dragon Lord.

### Meaty Read

A tome that grants the reader one of three spells at random:
- Meat Shield
	- Allows you to raise a corpse as a shield, following you around and taking hits until its body is blown to bits. Each hit knocks off a piece of it
- Corporeal Limb
	- Allows you to take a limb from a corpse and attach it to yourself, dealing passive bludgeoning damage as it punches or kicks whatever enemy dares approach you
- Bloody Mess
	- Allows you to explode a corpse, causing a mess of blood and bits to rain down on enemies, making the ground slippery and dealing damage

### Azaela's Pointy Shoes

A set of adventuring boots made out of the black scales of a sea serpent. The toe comes to a slight point and the soles of the shoe house a sharp heel that can be quickly flipped out for an elevated look. Or a hidden weapon, depending on the occasion.

### Blockbag

A bag made for an alchemist, with insides carved from wood and lined with soft, pliable sheepskin. A sturdy leather material wraps the outer shell

### Naruvi's Orb

An orb with the ability to draw out and contain the magical essence of other magical items.

### Intellite 

A greying crystal that grows along the skulls of deceased magic users. Intellite can be crushed and rubbed along the gums in order to gain a magical high for anyone, regardless of innate affinity for magic. Some unfortunate magic users, however, use it to boost their spells temporarily and grow addicted to it. Withdraws result in random bursts of wild magic exploding out of the addict.

### Mossmire Staff

A gnarled staff covered in moss that seeps with slimy, putrid smelling acid from the three rounded knots at the top

### Weighted Gaze

A set of glasses that allows the wearer to see across large distances, into other planes and even through objects, but only one at a time.

### Ring of Prismorphism

A ring of crystal that grows into a thin but hard armor shell around the body.

### Lumismic

A glass prism that houses a cloud of luminescent mist. It can change colors and form rudimentary shapes and symbols within based off of the desires of the wielder. Its light shines in all forms of darkness.

### Gloves of Sculpting

Gloves that allow the wearer to reshape any substance as if it were soft clay. Upon first contact, whatever material they touch will soften and bend to the wearer's motions and when removed the material will return to its original state.

## Vegetation
All ingredients are part of my *Beginners Guide to Alchemy*, which can be found on DMs Guild.

### Blood Grass

Grass tipped with red that grows in clumps in forested areas. Has a metallic taste and can be used to craft health potions or cooked into stews to add a slight healing property to them.

### Crab's Veil

A type of moss, it's a light, sandy brown with a gritty texture. This makes it easy to mistake as just a patch of sand on the beach. It is used to make Pincher Powder, which when combined with an explosive creates a cloud of sharp particles that slice any who pass through it.

### Cracklethorn

A spindly, thin, black vine that grows from the crevices along the sides of steam vents. It can be crushed up and used as a component in Pincher Powder or distilled into Cracklethorn Concentrate. 

### Moon Kelp

Kelp that grows along rocky coastlines that receive unobstructed moonlight every night. It glows a blueish silver on nights with a full moon, and turns black and jelly like during a new moon. When harvested during a full moon, it can be brewed into a glow potion that emits light that can pierce even magical darkness for a brief time. It tastes like slightly brined sea air, and if consumed raw it can make your mouth glow with moon beams for a short while.

### Sundrop Flower

Flowers that grow in sunny clearings, but only fully bloom when rain falls while the sun still shines. These blooms are extremely rare and coveted for their beauty as well as their use in a ritual to bring someone back from the brink of death to full health. They are even rumored to turn back time, a supposed component in potions for immortality and youth, though no one knows where these rumors started or if there is any truth to them.

### Puddleshroom

Brown, flat mushrooms that grow in places that tend to have puddles. They clump along the edges of puddles, disguised amid the mud and muck. They have no magical or medicinal properties, but those desperate enough to consume them know them to be delightful in texture with a meaty and earthy taste. They are extremely popular among more seasoned and experienced adventurers for use in stews or roasted over an open flame.

### Whisper Reeds
Tall reeds with perforated stems that emit a soft, airy song when the wind blows at the right speed through them. When they seed, they rattle slightly as well, making it sound faintly like incoherent whispers. They're used in potions and powders that cause confusion and fear, as well as those that can soften the voice of the consumer.
