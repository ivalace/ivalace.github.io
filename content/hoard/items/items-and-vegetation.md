## Alchemical Regents
All ingredients are part of my *Beginners Guide to Alchemy*, which can be found on DMs Guild.

### Crab's Veil

A type of moss, it's a light, sandy brown with a gritty texture. This makes it easy to mistake as just a patch of sand on the beach. It is used to make Pincher Powder, which when combined with an explosive creates a cloud of sharp particles that slice any who pass through it.

### Moon Kelp

Kelp that grows along rocky coastlines that receive unobstructed moonlight every night. It glows a blueish silver on nights with a full moon, and turns black and jelly like during a new moon. When harvested during a full moon, it can be brewed into a glow potion that emits light that can pierce even magical darkness for a brief time. It tastes like slightly brined sea air, and if consumed raw it can make your mouth glow with moon beams for a short while.

### Sundrop Flower

Flowers that grow in sunny clearings, but only fully bloom when rain falls while the sun still shines. These blooms are extremely rare and coveted for their beauty as well as their use in a ritual to bring someone back from the brink of death to full health. They are even rumored to turn back time, a supposed component in potions for immortality and youth, though no one knows where these rumors started or if there is any truth to them.

### Puddleshroom

Brown, flat mushrooms that grow in places that tend to have puddles. They clump along the edges of puddles, disguised amid the mud and muck. They have no magical or medicinal properties, but those desperate enough to consume them know them to be delightful in texture with a meaty and earthy taste. They are extremely popular among more seasoned and experienced adventurers for use in stews or roasted over an open flame.

### Whisper Reeds
Tall reeds with perforated stems that emit a soft, airy song when the wind blows at the right speed through them. When they seed, they rattle slightly as well, making it sound faintly like incoherent whispers. They're used in potions and powders that cause confusion and fear, as well as those that can soften the voice of the consumer.

### Intellite 

A greying crystal that grows along the skulls of deceased magic users. Intellite can be crushed and rubbed along the gums in order to gain a magical high for anyone, regardless of innate affinity for magic. Some unfortunate magic users, however, use it to boost their spells temporarily and grow addicted to it. Withdraws result in random bursts of wild magic exploding out of the addict.

## The Nether Isles' Items of Ascension
*Items from the late game quest line in my campaign.*
### Mossmire Staff

A gnarled staff wielded by a once moral shaman, she channeled the fell energies within her bog to trap trespassers in the mire. After her ascension to the demigoddess Beldraga Mirewatcher, her staff sunk into the bog, lost to time. It now infects the Shattered Bog, used by a hag who shares in her likeness. It's made of a sickly pale wood, covered in moss and seeping with slimy, putrid smelling acid from the three rounded knots at the top.

### Ethereal Gaze

Before his ascension, Taldrin Mothvale was a Plane Walker. His ability to travel between the planes and keep the peace was aided by the Ethereal Gaze, a set of overlapping lenses that allowed him sight through the veils that separated the planes. With a bit of tuning, the kaleidoscope lenses now allow the wearer to have a fraction of this power, limited to only one plane at a time.

### Ring of Prismorphism

Originally worn by Vorrun Facetbound, The Ring of Prismorphism is known to grant unparalleled protection, saving the wearer from death's blow. However, removing the indestructible armor is a feat none have managed to accomplish short of death. Before his ascension to demigod of Mountains and Mines, he was the protector of the Stormsong Peaks, keeping those who would delve too greedily into her depths in check.

### Lumismic

Zirra Syn'dorei was a Drow scholar in a lower clan who longed to feel the light of the surface without the painful price. Lumismic is the artifact she created to have a mere fraction of that light. A glass prism that houses a cloud of luminescent mist. Swirling, shifting, the mist has become nearly lifelike with her ascension. Its ability to change based on the wielder's moods giving it a psionic touch, Its light forever shines in all forms of darkness.

### Naruvi's Orb

Created by the High Priestess of the goddess Alva, Naruvi's orb was originally designed to draw magic from those who would horde it. The magic stored within the orb could then be redistributed among those with lesser powers. After Naruvi's ascension, the orb warped and now acts like a magnet, drawing the energies into itself until it's full and then redistributing them elsewhere in an unpredictable and explosive manner.
